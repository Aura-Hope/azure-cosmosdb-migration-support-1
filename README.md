# Introduction 
The Azure Cosmos DB Migration for MongoDB extension helps you assess your MongoDB workload for migrating to Azure Cosmos DB. You can use this extension to run an end-to-end assessment on your workload and find out the necessary actions you may need to take to seamlessly migrate your workloads to Azure Cosmos DB. 

The extension generates a customized report by running checks against the MongoDB features and functionalities that are specifically being used within your workload, ensuring that you get all the relevant insights in one place. After the assessment, you can migrate your workload to Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB with just a few clicks.

## Telemetry

This extension collects telemetry data, which is used to help understand how to improve the product. For example, this usage data helps to debug issues, such as slow start-up times, and to prioritize new features. While we appreciate the insights this data provides, we also know that not everyone wants to send usage data and you can disable telemetry as described in the Azure Data Studio [disable telemetry reporting](https://github.com/Microsoft/azuredatastudio/wiki/How-to-Disable-Telemetry-Reporting#how-to-disable-telemetry-reporting) documentation.
