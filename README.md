# Introduction 
The Azure Cosmos DB Migration for MongoDB extension helps you assess and migrate your MongoDB workload to Azure Cosmos DB. The end-to-end assessment helps you find out the necessary actions you may need to take to seamlessly migrate your workloads to Azure Cosmos DB.

After the assessment, you can migrate your workload to Azure Cosmos DB for MongoDB with just a few clicks:
1. Select the source.
1. Select the destination.
1. Review the assessment report and decide if you are good for migrations.
1. Migrate everything or identify the databases and collections you want to migrate.
1. Start the migration.

After capturing the migration configuration from the extension, the remaining process is executed on Azure cloud resources for a fast and efficient migration. You can monitor the progress of the migration in the extension. It is not necessary to be connected during the migration process.

## Telemetry

This extension collects telemetry data, which is used to help understand how to improve the product. For example, this usage data helps to debug issues, such as slow start-up times, and to prioritize new features. While we appreciate the insights this data provides, we also know that not everyone wants to send usage data and you can disable telemetry as described in the Azure Data Studio [disable telemetry reporting](https://github.com/Microsoft/azuredatastudio/wiki/How-to-Disable-Telemetry-Reporting#how-to-disable-telemetry-reporting) documentation.
